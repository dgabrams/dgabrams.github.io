		<h2> Bio </h2>
		<p> I became interested in art when I was in seventh grade, I decided to try my hand at photography which led to my passion for it,mainly photos of flora and fauna. I am currently attending Towson University working towards my degree in Digital Art and Design.  Most of my artwork consists of images that I have taken and manipulated through various programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>

		<p> I am a huge fan of William Wegman's photographs of his pet dogs.  I found this website dedicated to his work and I really liked the interactive images of his videos on the side.  They resemble old polaroids and you are able to shuffle through the images and pick a video to watch.  I think this would be an interesting feature for my website for the useres to sort through my photographs.
