		<h2> Bio </h2>
		<p> I became interested in art when I was in seventh grade, I decided to try my hand at photography which led to my passion for it,mainly photos of flora and fauna. I am currently attending Towson University working towards my degree in Digital Art and Design.  Most of my artwork consists of images that I have taken and manipulated through various programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>

		<p> I am a huge fan of William Wegman's photographs of his pet dogs.  I found this website dedicated to his work and I really liked the interactive images of his videos on the side.  They resemble old polaroids and you are able to shuffle through the images and pick a video to watch.  I think this would be an interesting feature for my website for the useres to sort through my photographs.

		<p> Nick Ainley is an artist that I have known about for many years. I love the artwork that he creates, it is highly detailed and awesome.  I like his website because he sets in all is artwork up in one huge grid, when you hover over the image you can click on the link that takes you to view the entire image, it is well organized and designed.</p>

		<p> I really enjoyed the layout for the home page of this website. It seems very simplistic at fist, until shapes come floating in from the top right corner. I thought this was a quirky feature and reminded me of confetti, I also liked how the text in the lower right corner changed, saying things about the developer like "I make websites" or "I drink coffee". </p>
